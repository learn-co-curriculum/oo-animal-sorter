## Description

You will be writing a class, `AnimalSorter` that, well, sorts a list of animals. It should take a list of animals on initialization, and instances should respond to a `.to_a` method.

## Instructions

Create a class called `AnimalSorter`. There will be two constants, which will be arrays, that AnimalSorter knows about: sea animals and land animals.

Land animals should contain the strings aardvark, cat, and elephant. Sea animals should contain the strings marlin, octopus, and fish.

Now that setup is out of the way, run the test suite with the `rspec` command.

Your program can have a pre-existing list of animal classifications.
